					<h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">I believe in personalized education. Everyone needs to go at a pace that they are comfortable to achieve an efficient learning outcome.
					<br>
					I believe that teachers need to employ a variety of teaching strategies in the classroom; with scaffolding being the anchor to whatever strategy is employed. This includes carefully-designed individual learning activities, group work and whole-class instruction, and connecting learning to the real world. I believe that successful outcomes depend on the quality of learner engagement and the opportunities provided for feedback between teacher and student. I believe that whole class instruction and one and one tutoring can be a highly effective instructional approach if it includes discussion and learners have the opportunity to respond and contribute. 
					<br>
					I believe in multiple and varied assessment practices that regularly inform students if they are reaching their objectives. These assessment techniques also allow learners to understand where they are on their learning journey and how they can improve.
					<br>
					My approach is one that relates concepts and skills in such a way that students learn to understand and appreciate the nature of Economics and what constitutes excellence for the developmental stage they are at. I seek to engage with learners’ mental ideas about the really important concepts, via a journey of discovery. This approach requires learners to revisit concepts over an extended period of time and within different contexts. This spiralling strategy reinforces learning and leads to deeper levels of understanding. 
					<br>
					Ultimately, my only goal is to have students perform at their optimal level of performance as opposed to a functional level which they could easily achieve on their own. In short my overall approach is geared towards raising student performance while preparing them to be independent, self-regulated learners equipped for modern life.

								<p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">Economics is not a strictly theoretical subject. It is a collection of historical trends and intuitive logic organized and generalized into more broadly encompassing theories that
									serve as tools to interpret and predict the impact of current events on the circulation of goods, services, and money. The approach Mr. Stewart used to teach Economics is very much based on understanding the logic
									behind the theories and gaining the skill to derive such theories through intuition. While memorization of terms are necessary, most of the learning comes from building a mindset or thought process to intuitively
									evaluate economical situations. While this approach may at first be intimidating, once you get used to the learning style, you will learn not only economics, but also how to think.<br></p>

									When you step into the class, you don’t just learn passively — you connect the concepts you learn with
									real-life events. This style of teaching is what makes Mr. Stewart’s class unique. As a recipient of the
									Western Faculty Entrance Scholarship and an incoming first-year into the Western Medical Sciences
									program, I can say with utmost confidence that the critical thinking skills and work ethic built from Mr.
									Stewart’s class have enabled me to thrive. Having been very shy in Grade 10, Mr. Stewart has helped me
									develop the confidence to share my opinions in front of others. Not only have I become more engaged
									with world events, but the problem-solving and communication skills that I’ve built are something that I
									will carry with me forever.<br></p>

									long-term implications of economic and social policies. Most importantly, my Economics class was where I made some of the most unforgettable memories in high school. From listening to "Is it Friday yet" every

									utilize various sources of knowledge to develop logical

								<p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">Economics is an unbelievable course, facilitating and nurturing a new way of thinking to
									approach and solve problems. Unlike some other subjects, where you learn passively, in
									economics, you use critical thinking and logic to analyze real-life
									situations, apply the concepts taught, and from there, decide on
									the best solution. As a second year student with a pre-acceptance
									into the Richard Ivey School of Business, I can say that this form of
									thinking has been beneficial in my classes. The Richard Ivey School
									of Business is well known for its case-based learning strategy, and
									I feel that the way grade 11 and 12 IB economics was taught by
									Mr. Stewart gave me the appropriate mindset needed to
									approach these cases. Apart from that, the analytical skills, decision-making abilities, and work
									ethic that are part of the DNA of IB economics at Bayview are of great importance, and can be
									applied to any field of study.

								<p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">Mr. Stewart was my teacher for IB HL Economics throughout my time at Bayview Secondary
									School. I can say with conviction that taking his class was one of the best decisions of my high
									school career.
									While choosing courses for my junior and senior year
									at Bayview, I was unsure at the time whether history
									or economics would suit me best. I had taken one
									history course during sophomore year, so I had a basic
									concept of the topics and work that history classes
									would entail. Although I had a great experience with
									history classes at Bayview, I wanted a class that would
									provide me with great analytical skills, applicability to
									real-life scenarios/current events, and abstract,
									intellectual discussions. Taking a risk at the last
									minute, I decided to change my original plan in takingIB History to IB Economics instead. This
									decision would prove to be a life-defining one. Not only did I get everything I wanted in a high
									school course, I also developed a strong passion for the subject and even declared my major in
									Business Economics at my eventual post-secondary destination, UCLA.
									Even today, as a second-year student at UCLA, I draw direct connections to the teachings of Mr.
									Stewart in my university-level economics classes. I received course credit for two economics
									classes due to my IB scores and was expedited to the third course in that series. Despite
									entering an intermediate microeconomics class at UCLA without having taken the prerequisites,
									I was still able to rely on my strong foundation from Mr. Stewart’s class, achieving a rank within
									the top 15% of my peers and earning an A in the class. Additionally, IB Economics was
									responsible for sparking my interest in the financial industry. By knowing what my passions
									were early in my undergraduate career, I was able to be proactive about my professional
									development and have managed to earn various internships and other opportunities with
									investment banks and consulting firms as a second-year student.
									Ending with a few closing remarks, if you find yourself in the position where I was 4 years ago,
									don’t hesitate to explore and try out IB Economics. If you want a truly intellectually stimulating
									class, one that will provide you direction for the future, and one that will guarantee you
									enjoyable and memorable moments, IB Economics is exactly the course you are looking for.

								<p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">As cliché as it may sound, HL Economics with Mr. Stewart changed the way I think. See, Mr. Stewart doesn’t just teach his students economics; he makes them live it. He teaches in an
									indescribable way that intertwines theory with application and brings textbook material to reality.<br>Each lesson Mr. Stewart delivers is crafted in a way where students do more than thinking—they learn to think
									how to think. This metacognitive approach is paired with his proprietary Socratic teaching methods to make sure that his students are fully prepared to make a difference in the world, much less attain a simple 7 on
									the IB exam. More importantly, Mr. Stewart genuinely cares about his students. Our occasional class karaokes, impromptu colouring sessions, and group skits only scrape the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Stewart is the
									type of person to make sure that each and every one of his students is not only prepared for the IB exam, but for life in general. He’s the type of person who you’ll want to grab dim sum with after the IB exams,
									and the person who’ll be the reason why you would want to come back to visit Bayview.<br>And for HL Economics? It is by far the best course available to take in the Bayview IB program. The material you learn from
									this course will actually help in guiding the decisions you make everyday, from deciding what new brand of clothes you want to buy to your vote in the next election, as well as developing a framework for how you
									view global issues, from international relationships to poverty. The course will be an amazing adventure to embark on in your IB journey that will undoubtedly make the most impact for your future.<br>Take it from
									someone who, during his time at Bayview, was the President of Bayview DECA and Bayview FBLA and attained a 7 with ease under Mr. Stewart's guidance. Choosing HL Economics is the one choice you will make that you
									will never regret.<br></p>

								<p class="mbr-fonts-style display-7">In my time as a student at Bayview Secondary School, few courses will have the lasting impact that HL Economics with Mr. Stewart has had on me as I push forwards throughout my
									post-secondary education. Rather than the traditional lecture teaching styles that are found in most classrooms, HL Economics has consistently pushed a different brand of teaching that focuses on class engagement
									and applied intuitive thinking. This applied intuitive thinking is one of the amazing aspects of economics here at Bayview because of how grounded it is in our everyday lives. Mr. Stewart achieves this by helping
									us translate the concepts that we see on our notes and PowerPoints in class into its applications in the current world around us. In fact, not only is HL Economics with Mr. Stewart an amazing economics course, but
									it is also an amazing life course where you will learn responsibility and work ethic that will carry on with you into university and the workplace. Although my program choice in University ultimately was not in
									economics, I know that the valuable critical thinking, analysis, communication, teamwork, and organizational skills that I have learned throughout this course will benefit me in every aspect of my life whether it
									is in the workplace or my personal life. Mr. Stewart will always push you to be your best and he is one of the most committed teachers towards student success that I have met. There was never a dull moment in the 3
									semesters I had with Mr. Stewart, and I strongly urge whoever is reading this to seriously consider taking this course. It was 100% one of the best decisions I have ever made in my IB career. If you have already
									decided on HL Economics, or if you’re reading this during your first semester of economics classes? Great! Buckle up and enjoy the ride, it really will be an experience of a lifetime.<br></p>

									perspective on the way we understand the world. Economics is the underlying mechanism
									behind so many government policies, public institutions, and personal choices.<br>Mr. Stewart’s unique problem-based approach to teaching allows students to apply economic
									theory taught on paper to real-life examples. This is perhaps the most influential part of his
									course; it has opened up my understanding of various events happening around me in the
									world, from local policies to international agreements to the pollution of global resources. His
									engaging classes truly establish intuition and logical thinking, two traits I believe are important to
									develop global-minded thinkers.<br>Every student can benefit from taking economics at Bayview. Mr. Stewart teaches analytical and

									Johns Hopkins University, I use these skills developed in his class to complete and excel in my
